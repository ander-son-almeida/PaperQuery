# About

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for 2,288,861 scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, 
quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. Materials on this site are not peer-reviewed by arXiv.

In order to optimize bibliographic reviews using the library, this application was developed. With it you enter a maximum of 4 keywords - in order of importance for the query. 
The API is triggered by returning a list of downloadable papers compressed into a zip file.

Thanks and credits to [arXiv API](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/basics.html#about) contributors and Lukas Schwab for adapting a [Python version](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv.py) of this API.
